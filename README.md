### Of Mice And Men
## A game using OSC, p5.js, a lighting system and a motion capture system

For this project I created an interactive gaming experience in which two participants play each other virtually and physically, chasing one another in arena. One player, the evil cat, is on a computer and chases a virtual mouse with his or her arrow keys. The other player, the innocent mouse, enters the motion capture arena with a motion capture wand and avoids the evil red light chasing him or her and tried to get to the green lights (the cheeses) before losing. 

My project explores how human emotion changes behind the computer screen and examines whether we act differentlyÂ knowing that there are consequences to our computer actions.


## Steps To Run:
### (A) Open Terminal 
    git clone https://github.com/MaxGreenwald/Of-Mice-And-Men.git

3) Run Bridge.JS

    node bridge.js

### (C) Open p5
### (D) Open "sketch.js" in Of-Mice-And-Men/RetroGame folder
